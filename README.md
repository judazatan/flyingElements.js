# flyingElements.js
jQuery Easing extension based on jQuery 3.2.1 and jQuery Easing 1.3

jQuery Easing - accelerations applied to "ranges" so that they can be applied depending on (for example) scroll positions and 
can not be called only on fixed events. The accelerations are interpolated here and thus theoretically can also be applied 
to colors, frames or even note sequences and not just to positions.

Inspired by Parralax, jQuery and jQuery.easing
